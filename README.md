# Sort visualizer
This project was made in order to practice implementing diffrent sorting algorithms in to the code.
The project visualizes the work on each algorithm. User can change array size and switch between sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms 

* Quick sort
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort

## Responsibilities:

* Building up a typescript project
* Implementing OPP
* Implementing async functions
* Using diffrent sorting algorithms


## Technologies:

* Typescript
* Webpack
* Git
